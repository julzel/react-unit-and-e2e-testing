# REACT TESTING LIBRARY

## List of Topics


- [Introduction to React Testing Library:](./documentation/1-Introduction.md) This should cover the basics of what React Testing Library is, how it differs from other testing libraries like Enzyme, and why it's useful for testing React components.

- [Setting up your testing environment](./documentation/2-Setting-up-your-testing-environment.md) This should cover how to install and configure the necessary dependencies for testing with React Testing Library, including Jest, React Testing Library, and any other necessary testing utilities.

- [Writing your first test](./documentation/3-Writing-your-first-test.md) This should cover the basics of writing a simple test using React Testing Library, including how to render a component, interact with it, and make assertions about its state.

- [Testing user interactions](./documentation/4.Testing%20user%20interactions.md) This should cover how to simulate user interactions such as clicks, typing, and form submissions, and how to test the resulting changes to the component's state or UI.

- [Testing async code](#5-testing-async-code) This should cover how to test components that make asynchronous requests or use async functions, and how to handle async code in your test suite using tools like async/await or Jest's done callback.

- [Mocking dependencies](#6-mocking-dependencies) This should cover how to use mocking and stubbing to isolate components from external dependencies like APIs or other modules, and how to write tests that ensure the component is behaving as expected when those dependencies are mocked.

- [Testing accessibility](#7-testing-accessibility) This should cover how to use React Testing Library's accessibility features to ensure that your components are usable and understandable for all users, including those with disabilities.

- [Snapshot testing](#8-snapshot-testing) This should cover how to use snapshot testing to quickly verify that a component's UI hasn't changed unexpectedly, and how to handle snapshot failures.

- [Best practices](#9-best-practices) This should cover some best practices for testing with React Testing Library, such as keeping tests simple and focused, avoiding implementation details, and using semantic queries to select elements in your component.
